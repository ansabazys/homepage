## 🌐 New Tab Extension

A personal Chrome extension that replaces the default new tab with my **custom homepage** (Flocus-like).  
Currently built for my own use, but I may make it public in the future. 🚀


### ✨ Features
- ⏰ Clock with greeting (Good Morning / Afternoon / Evening).  
- 🔍 Search bar (Google search or direct URLs).  
- 📌 Quick links to favorite websites.  
- 🎨 Clean, minimal UI.
